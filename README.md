## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to create a responsive site using the design images provided by Frontend Mentor while also allowing users to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Working on this allowed me to gain experience and try a number of things new to me. Concepts I had previously learned like working with Flexbox and Grids, using the BEM naming convention, etc. were reinforced. As for learnings, for one, I learned how to implement lightboxes. I also grasped how to implement image slideshows, both by using arrows and also by clicking on image thumbnails.

<!---```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```



```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.--->

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to try incorporating other front-end related technologies that I did not make use of here (e.g. React, TailwindCSS), to gain understanding and experience with them.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - An excellent resource full of information on how to effectively work with CSS.
- [CSS color to filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This was helpful with easily applying color changes to icons in this project.
